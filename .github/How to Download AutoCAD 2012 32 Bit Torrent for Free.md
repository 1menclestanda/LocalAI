You can also use some tools such as [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) or [URLVoid](https://www.urlvoid.com/) to scan the URL of the torrent site and see if it has any malware or phishing alerts.

There are many VPN services available on the market, but not all of them are reliable or compatible with torrenting. Some of them may slow down your connection speed or leak your data. Therefore, you need to choose a VPN service that has fast servers, strong encryption, no-logs policy, and P2P support.
