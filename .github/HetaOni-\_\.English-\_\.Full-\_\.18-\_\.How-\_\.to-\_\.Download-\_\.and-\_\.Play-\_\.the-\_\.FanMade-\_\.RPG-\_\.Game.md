## HetaOni English Full 18: A Guide to the Gameplay and Tips for Beginners
 
HetaOni English Full 18 is not a game for the faint of heart. It is a challenging and emotional game that requires strategy, puzzle-solving, and quick reflexes. The game is divided into 18 parts, each with its own story, events, and endings. You can control different characters from the Hetalia cast, each with their own abilities and personalities. You can also interact with other characters and items in the mansion, which can affect the outcome of the game.
 
The gameplay of HetaOni English Full 18 is similar to that of Ao Oni, but with some differences. You can explore the mansion using the arrow keys and interact with objects using the spacebar or enter key. You can also access the menu using the escape key, where you can save your progress, check your inventory, and change your settings. However, unlike Ao Oni, you can also fight against the Oni using a turn-based combat system. You can choose different actions such as attack, defend, use items, or run away. You can also switch between characters during battle using the tab key.
 
However, fighting against the Oni is not always the best option. Sometimes, you have to hide or run away from it using stealth or quick movements. The Oni can appear randomly or at certain points in the game, and it will chase you until you escape or die. If you die, you will have to load your last save file or start over from the beginning. Therefore, it is important to save frequently and be prepared for anything.
